An extension release tracking task for this extension has been opened at
{{ task_link }}. @{{ username }} please update it to reflect the current state of
this extension merge request and request review, if applicable. (Sub-tasks have
been added automatically, and more will be added as it moves through the
process. You are welcome to add your own sub-tasks for your own usage.)

You should also update the [OpenXR Extensions Workboard][board] according to
the status of your extension: most likely this means moving it to 'NeedsReview'
once you complete the self-review steps in the checklist.

See the [OpenXR Extensions Board Overview][overview] for the flowchart showing
the extension workboard process, and hover over the 'Info' 🛈 icons on the board
for specific details.

You {%- if outside_ipr_policy %} may also want to {% else %} must also {% endif -%}
request feedback from other WG members through our chat at <https://chat.khronos.org>
{%- if not outside_ipr_policy %} as well as discussion in weekly calls{% endif %}.
